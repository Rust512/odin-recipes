    <h1>Peas and Cottage Cheese</h1>

    <p>
        Mutter (meaning peas) paneer (a semi-solid form of cottage cheese) 
        is probably the most frequently ordered vegetarian dish in Indian restaurants. 
        The mild flavors of the paneer (cottage cheese) and peas in it, 
        marry beautifully with the delicious tomato-based sauce of this curry. 
        Mutter paneer is a great side dish in a non-vegetarian meal but also 
        the perfect main dish in a vegetarian one. Serve it with chapati, paratha, 
        or naan or even on a bed of plain boiled basmati rice. Basically, 
        make and serve it in your home and you've got a sure crowd pleaser!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 tablespoons vegetable oil, or canola oil, or sunflower cooking oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound paneer, cubed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
        <li>2 green chiles, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup shelled peas</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups hot water</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/3 cup fresh cilantro leaves, finely chopped, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather the ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Grind the onions into a fine paste in a food processor. Keep aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next grind tomatoes into a fine paste and keep aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons of the vegetable oil in a deep pan and gently stir-fry the cubes of paneer till golden.
        </li>
        <li>
            When golden, remove onto a paper towel and keep aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the same vessel, heat the remaining 2 to 3 tablespoons of the vegetable oil 
            and add the onion paste. Fry till it turns light brown. You will need to stir 
            frequently to avoid the paste burning. Also, do not over-fry as it will turn 
            bitter and ruin the curry. Another hassle-free way to do this is to chop the 
            onions fine and then sauté till pale golden, then grind in the food processor.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the onion paste is fried, add tomato paste, ginger and garlic paste, 
            and sauté for another 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next, add the coriander, cumin, turmeric, and garam masala powders, 
            and the finely chopped green chiles and sauté, stirring continuously, 
            till the cooking oil begins to separate from the masala (spice mixture).
        </li>
        <li>
            Now add the peas to the masala and fry for 2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then add the previously fried paneer, hot water, and salt, to taste, 
            reduce the heat to a simmer and cook till the gravy thickens.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the gravy is as thick as you would like, turn off the heat and stir in the cream.
        </li>
        <li>
            Garnish with coriander leaves and serve with chapati, paratha, naan, or jeera rice.
        </li>
    </ol>
